            <h2>👾 About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I have way too many interests—drawing, designing, fun coding, playing Roblox, and watching anime or films. I enjoy studying only when it truly interests me or feels important.
              <br><br>
              Balancing college and life? Still figuring that out. I'm an overthinker, way too harsh on myself, and often stuck in a loop of negative thoughts.
              <br><br>
              Instagram? Not my thing anymore. Feels fake, overly polished, and full of stuff I don’t want to see. So, I made this little corner of the internet just for me—to post my art, designs, code, and whatever makes me happy. 🌱
              <br><br>
              A lil more about me:

        <p>
          The other night, I couldn’t stop crying. My overthinking and insecurities took over, and I felt like the worst version of myself. I couldn’t sleep, so instead of spiraling, I started building this website.
          I know my emotions often get the best of me—but maybe, just maybe, I can still figure out my life.

      <h3 class="blog-title">Wrong Decisions</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p class="date">Date: 08/04/2025</p>
        <p>
          I’ve made a lot of wrong decisions for myself. The course I’m studying doesn’t interest me and feels totally out of sync with my career goals.
          <br><br>
          I chose Computer Applications… and bro, I’m failing at it. I didn’t know I’d suck this much. I regret it so bad.
          I really wanted to go to a government design college, but financial issues got in the way. Private colleges? Hella expensive, bruh.
          <br><br>
          Sometimes, I just wish I had a shoulder to cry on… or someone to hug me and make me feel loved.
          But maybe that kind of luck just isn’t for me. :)

      <h3 class="blog-title">My Social Life Sucks</h3>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <p class="date">Date: 08/04/2025</p>
        <p>
          I don’t really have a social life in real life.
          It sucks seeing people out there living their best lives while mine feels like a mess.
          <br><br>
          Sometimes I think… maybe I just need money to have a better social life.
          I mean, who would even want to hang out with someone who’s broke or has nothing flashy to offer? :)
